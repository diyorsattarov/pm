## To-Do List for Test Fixture Improvement

1. **Add More Test Cases**:
   - [ ] Create test cases for different HTTP methods (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - [ ] Cover various HTTP response codes in your test cases.
   - [ ] Test different API endpoints and data scenarios.

2. **Expand Error Handling**:
   - [ ] Extend error handling tests to cover network errors, timeouts, and invalid responses.

3. **Fixture Reuse**:
   - [ ] Consider creating a base test fixture to consolidate common setup and teardown procedures.

4. **Parameterized Tests**:
   - [ ] Implement parameterized tests to run the same test with different input data.

5. **Custom Matchers**:
   - [ ] Create custom Google Test matchers for more readable and expressive assertions.

6. **Mocking**:
   - [ ] Explore Google Mock or other mocking frameworks to simulate external service interactions.

7. **Test Performance**:
   - [ ] Assess performance and scalability by testing with larger payloads and varying network conditions.

8. **Test Documentation**:
   - [ ] Add comments to test cases and fixtures to explain their purpose and scenarios.

9. **Refactoring and Code Quality**:
   - [ ] Periodically review and refactor test code for readability and maintainability.

10. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
    - [ ] Integrate the test suite into your CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on code changes.
